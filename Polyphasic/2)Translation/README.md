# Task 2B : Developing a Translation Model for Cross-Language Communication

In this task, our objective is to explore and create a language translation model that excels in the domain of cross-language communication and document translation. 

I have used the following pre-trained model for this task: [huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr?text=In+1981%2C+he+founded+the+Astronomy+Club+of+Rimouski+in+Quebec.)

The model_params_translate folder has been ignored as it is heavy.
